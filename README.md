Salad
=====
Salaad aims to bring the full scale of Cucumber ad RSpec over from Ruby to C#. In the next few weeks I will attempt to translate all the ruby code into C#.

Please feel free to send me ideas and suggestions and well as code.

```csharp
using Salad.Spec.Core;
using Salad.Spec.Mocks;
using Salad.Spec.Expectations;

namespace Salad.Sample
{
    public class Example
    {

    }
}


```
